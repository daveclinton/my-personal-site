# 'Ey Legend 😊,

So, I’m mostly into mobile app development, yeah, with React Native and all that jazz, but I’ve been known to stick my nose into a bit of everything—web apps, command-line stuff, you name it. If you fancy a good read on a lazy Sunday, you can sign up for my [Substack](https://daveclintonn.substack.com/) and get my latest musings delivered right to your inbox.

Now, my blog isn’t just me rabbiting on. Nah, it’s a space for us to have a bit of back-and-forth, so feel free to give me a shout if:

- 🧰 **There’s somethin’ you’re curious about** and wanna see on the blog.
- 🪜 **You’ve got some wicked resources** for up-and-coming software devs.
- 😁 **Or even if you just wanna say**, “How’s it goin', mate?”

Always up for a natter and happy to share more. Have a butcher’s at my [About](/about) page if you're keen.

Oh, and right now, I’m tinkerin’ with [globe.gl](https://globe.gl/) to bring some spicy analytics to the page. Fancy a peek? Check it out [here](/analytics).
