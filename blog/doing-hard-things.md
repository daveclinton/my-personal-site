I have a problem with easy things. Doing hard things in any job is rarely comfortable, but that’s where the bread is. That’s what compounds your growth. For example:

> Eating junk food is unhealthy, but it’s easy.  
>
> Vibe coding is easy, but it doesn’t improve your problem-solving skills.

The gate to doing easy things is wide open, and most people will just take it. Because the invitation is free.

In one of [DHH's posts](https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-don-t-more-people-use-linux-33b75f53), he said:  
**"It’s easier to be fat and ignorant in a world of cheap, empty calories than it is to be fit and informed."**

Software engineering is getting easier every day with better tools, tighter abstractions, faster ecosystems.  
So where's the leftover bread?...

Doing hard things does not mean comparing yourself to passionate nerds. They are built different. But how do you learn hard things? You actually have to care about it.

For instance. I got into learning Rust and dropped after sometime. Whatever I did, I couldn't get myself enjoying learning the language. On the other, I was and I am very interested into getting to know Systems Level Programming.

Now, I have realized that I need to be comfortable with the boring parts of programming. Because, It's possible that there are people out there doing hard things and they don't like the process.

It's like going for a hike. It's not exactly fun. It takes a lot of strength, and the climb takes a long time. But then there's that satisafaction you get at the top or end of the hike. That's what you put all the work in for.
