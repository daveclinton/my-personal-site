I have a problem with easy things. Doing hard things in any job is rarely comfortable, but that’s where the bread is. That’s what compounds your growth. For example:

> Eating junk food is unhealthy, but it’s easy.  
>
> Vibe coding is fun, but it doesn’t improve your problem-solving skills.

The gate to doing hard things is wide open, but most people ignore it.

In one of [DHH's posts](https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-don-t-more-people-use-linux-33b75f53), he said:  
**"It’s easier to be fat and ignorant in a world of cheap, empty calories than it is to be fit and informed."**

Software engineering is getting easier every day with better tools, tighter abstractions, faster ecosystems.  
So where's the leftover bread?...
