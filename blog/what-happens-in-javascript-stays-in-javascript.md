To be a succesfull Software Engineer, you have to be dangerous and confident. You have to believe in the process, even when you're not sure that it will work out. I've worked fulltime and built all kinds of project in Javascript across web, mobile, server platforms you name it. But it's mostly been for the pay check. But now, I wish to work on something I believe in. Something I enjoy. Something that makes me sharp and unstoppable.

In 2023 and 2024, I have been jumping between languages (Javascript, Typescript, Java and Rust). It was fun, chaotic, and honestly... kind of exhausting. I went in between too many tools and **no real foundation**.

I realized I was doing what I advice many devs not to do:
> Confusing activity for progress

## Switching My Focus Now(April, 17th)

I have decided to go into the badlands, **deep inside**, that means android for me.

- Native applications with Kotlin + Jetpack Compose
- Real UI, real users, real problem
- Document my progress

## My Weekly Structure

**Monday to Sartuday- 2hrs/day**
> Android development. Building real stuff. Learning Jetpack, architecture patterns, API integration, etc.

**Evenings — C++ Playground**
> Just fun. Data structures, small tools, exploring the language with no pressure.

**Sunday — Reflection**
> What did I learn this week? What went wrong? What’s next?


## Will this work out?
I am here to find out.
This time, I'm not trying to do everything. I am doing one thing, deeply.

### Happy for myself

JavaScript taught me a lot. But what happens in JavaScript… stays in JavaScript.

Native is home now.
