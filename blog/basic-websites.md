title: Most frameworks can be overkill for basic websites

A couple of weeks ago, I [saw a tweet](https://x.com/tipiirai/status/1906935615871942873) saying: "Apps lighter than a single React button." And it sounded interesting! I was curious to see what moment the article linked to it would give me. React is popular, it has been massively adopted, it got me into a serious company. But:

> It just has too much boilerplate.

> Hundreds of choices of tooling like styling solutions, build tools, and it's own learning curve.

> The ecosystem changes everyday.

> Too much engineering for simple things

> Debugging old code is harder

I have genuinely lost count of the number of websites I have built since my first ( probably 7 years ago). Most of which have an absurd amount of Typescript. 

When I came across [Nue](https://nuejs.org/), I got **sold**. It is not just minimal effort, but everything has been taken back to the basics. Putting it simpley, it is easy to build using Nue than it is to use React. And Nue isn't just simple. It brings the good old web development **fun** back to the forefront.

I tried out Nue by builidng a [portfolio website](https://ngomathebrand.cc/) for a fried who wanted something that looked like the offical Nike Site. I finished it in a day. A week later, I thought, why not rebuild my blog with Nue too? So I switched from Next.js and found that it is a ridiculously easier alternative.

The Nue framework is geared towards semantic HTML and less Javascript. Put it simply as standard HTML, and functionalities can be extended with custom HTML-based components.


Web developers are different. Or ought to be different. They have never been loyal. They can adapt a new tech. We can make buidling websites simpler again.
