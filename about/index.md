# About Me

Well, I'm David Clinton. I enjoy building things that are clear, fast, and actually useful. One of the things I also care about is making tech easy to understand, scalable, and feel a little more human.

My first role in tech was at [Paperspace](https://blog.paperspace.com/author/david-clinton/) **now acquired by Digital Ocean**, where I spent a year building machine learning projects and sometimes wrote technical documentation that made it less of a punishment for tech savvy people to read.

After that, I joined [Untapped Global](https://untapped-global.com/) as a React Engineer. I spent three years helping build an investment platform used by high net worth individuals. Think money meets dashboards meets a lot of late nights.

These days, I’ve taken the consulting route and worked with a handful of interesting teams:

- [Snaplist](https://www.snaplist.app/): Built a third-party mobile marketplace app for sellers on platforms like eBay and Facebook Marketplace.
- [Milner Fresh](https://www.milnerfresh.com/): Helped launch an online marketplace for exporting fresh produce globally.
- [GiveSuite](https://givesuite.com/): Developed fundraising funnels and donation forms for nonprofits — making it easier for organizations to raise money and tell their stories.

I like working at the intersection of clean code, good design, and strong documentation. Whether it’s front-end, full-stack, or a weird edge case no one wants to touch, I’m in.

If you're building something meaningful and need someone who can code *and* explain things clearly, let’s talk — [My Email](mailto:clintondavid46@gmail.com).
