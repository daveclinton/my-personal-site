# ðŸ§  Dump Zone

Welcome to the messy drawer of my brain, where I tuck away interesting, quirky, occasionally dubious links I find along the way on the internet. This is not a blog. It's unfiltered. It's simply my audio pocket. Like bookmarks. but audible.

Come back here if you want to:

- See what Iâ€™ve been reading at 3am.
- Wonder why thereâ€™s a CSS trick next to a neuroscience paper.
- Feel better about your own tab situation.

No order. No logic. Just vibes.
