# ðŸ§  Dump Zone

Welcome to this section of my brain, where I save interesting, genius, occasionally controversial content I find along the way on the Internet. It's unfiltered. It's simply my audio pocket. Like bookmarks, but audible.

Come back and take a pick anytime:

- See what I have been reading randomly at midnight
- Wonder why thereâ€™s a CSS trick that you have never heard of.
- Feel like you need to add more tabs to your own.

No order. No logic. Just pure vibes.

## ðŸš§ Warning

This is a rotating door of chaos. Stuff comes and goes. Some links may rot. Some may slap. Click responsibly.

Want a clean version of this? Sorry, wrong site.

Got a link I *have* to see? [Ping me](mailto:clintondavid46@gmail.com). Iâ€™ll probably throw it on here and pretend I found it myself.
